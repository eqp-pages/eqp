When your page gains more than 150 followers, its opportunity for growth increases exponentially! As a page admin, you can invite your 1st-degree connections to follow the page either through your Admin Tools or your Follower Analytics sections on your Company Page. Also, employees of your page can invite 30 of their own 1st-degree connections every month to follow the page as well.

Pages that post (at least) weekly have over 5x more followers than pages that post monthly, and their following grows 7x faster than monthly posting Pages. The more often you post, the more you can increase audience and trust for your brand. Now you can also follow other LinkedIn pages to join conversations and view their content to get inspired.

Pages that post daily expand their audience 8x faster than those that post weekly. Keeping your audience engaged becomes even more important when you're posting frequently and the best way you can do this is to diversify your content by hosting a Live Event or creating a Newsletter! They are a great way to highlight your thought leadership, your company's culture, or even new product announcements!
